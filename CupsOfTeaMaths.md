## Cups of tea maths workout and sources.
To approach the working out for this calculation you first need to find out what the electricity consumption of a kettle boiling.

> "Kettle: around 2p to boil a full kettle: **The average kettle holds
> 1.5 litres of water and uses about 0.1 kWh of electricity to boil for 3 minutes.** That’s around 2p every time you boil a full kettle."

___

Then if you divide the Total Annualised Yearly Electric Consumption for ETH by the 0.1kWh from the source above to get how many kettles of water we could boil with the same amount of electricity giving us:

> **501,000,000,000** full kettle boils from 50.1TWh of electricity.

Then we need to find out the average amount of boiled water used per cup of tea.

> When most people refer to a cup of tea, the cup is filled to about 1.5 cm (or about half an inch) below the rim. That is **150 ml** (or 5 ounces), to round numbers for easy reference.

Meaning that from the 50.1TWh of electricity consumed by running the Ethereum blockchain is the same as making:

**3,006,000,000,000** cups of tea.
